### Welcome!

My first ML project with Python. I classified different types of glass using **Random Forest, MLP and Decision Tree** methods. I found the best variables with the **Feature Selection**, and optimized the parameters with the **GridSearchCV** method. I combined three modeling methods with the **Voting Classifier** and completed my machine learning project.

*I shared the data set with the code. You can use it as you wish.*
